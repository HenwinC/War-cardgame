# War-cardgame
To play this game please click on the link in the features section. I chose to code the game of war to learn more about how JavaScript works. Also, I have alwayed liked playing card games.

This is how the game works:
War is a card game for two players. A standard deck of 52 cards is dealt so that both players have 26 cards. During each round of battle, both players play a card from the top of their hand face up. The player who plays the card of the higher value wins both cards and places them at the bottom of their stack of cards. If both cards played are of the same value, then War is initiated --both players play three additional cards face down and then one more card face up. The player who wins the war by playing the higher card wins all ten cards. If the value are still the same, additional war are played until one player wins the War. If either player has less than 4 cards before war, they lose the game. The player that accumulates all 52 cards leaving an opponent with no cards is the other way to be crowned a winner.
